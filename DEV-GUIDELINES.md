# TypeScript Notes and Syntax
- Always use TypeScript styling for classes, methods/function definition syntax.
- Create Enums types when there is a choice in values.  Use the enum types in the definitions, assignments, and comparisons.
- Create Unit Tests for all Classes and Services.
- Follow the project structure strictly.
- Use proper TypeScript types throughout the application.
- Use ?? instead of || for null coalescing
- Use the object?.property?.value notation when checking for null values in a chain
- Test for unassigned explicitly, not with shortcut notation.
